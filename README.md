# Memory Management Visualization

This project is a simulation of how an operating system performs memory management using the first-fit algorithm. It allocates memory dynamically and uses dynamic data structures within the allocated memory.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is primarily for learning. It provides a visualization or simulation of memory management techniques used by operating systems. It demonstrates how memory is allocated, deallocated, and managed using OS algorithms.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Compile the source files using `make`:

4. Run the executable:

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a data structure to visualize.
